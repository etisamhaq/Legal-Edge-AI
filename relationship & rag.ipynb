Export of Goods: When a taxable person makes a supply of goods from one implementing state to a person who has a place of residence in another implementing state, and the supply requires the goods to be physically moved to that other implementing state, the taxable person is required to retain official and commercial evidence of the export of those goods to that other implementing state.\n",
      "2. Customs Departments' Confirmation: The Customs Departments are responsible for confirming the type and quantity of the exported goods with its exported documents.\n",
      "3. Exceptions: There are some exceptions related to deemed supply of goods. For instance, the value of the supply of goods for each recipient within a 12-month period shall not exceed AED 500. Additionally, the total output tax payable on all deemed supplies shall not exceed AED 2,000 for each supplier within a 12-month period, and any amount exceeding this threshold shall be considered payable tax.\n",

      "\n",
      "a. The granting, assignment, cessation, or surrender of a right.\n",
      "b. The making available of a facility or advantage.\n",
      "c. Not participating in any activity, or not allowing its occurrence, or agreeing to perform any activity.\n",

      "e. The transfer or licensing of intangible rights, such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, and other similar rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that certain activities are explicitly excluded from the definition of a supply of services. Specifically, the functions of a member of a board of directors, performed by a natural person appointed as such, for any government entity or private sector establishment, are not considered a supply of services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, healthcare services are subject to specific rules regarding their taxation. According to Article 41, healthcare services are zero-rated if they are supplied by a licensed healthcare body or institution, doctor, nurse, technician, dentist, or pharmacy and relate to the wellbeing of a human being. However, certain types of healthcare services are excluded from this definition, such as those provided in the course of holiday accommodation or entertainment, or elective treatment for cosmetic reasons that is not prescribed by a doctor for treating or preventing a medical condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the place of supply of certain transportation services is defined in Article 22 as the place where the supply of the transportation service commences. The place of supply of transport-related services is the same as the place of supply of the transportation service to which they relate.\n",
